        A set is an unordered collection of objects that doesnâ€™t allow duplicate elements. Typically, sets are used to quickly test a value for membership in the set, to insert or delete new values from a set, and to compute the union or intersection of two sets.

In a proper set implementation, membership tests are expected to run in fast O(1) time. Union, intersection, difference, and subset operations should take O(n) time on average.
